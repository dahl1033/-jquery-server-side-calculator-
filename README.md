## Installation

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.


1. The `server.js` file is set up to GET and POST data to and from our array. The project is built on [[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed.
2. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
3. Run `npm init --yes` in your terminal
4. Run `npm install express` in your terminal
5. Run `npm install body-parser` in your terminal
6. Run `node server/server.js` in your terminal to boot up server
